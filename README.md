# Zillow Clone (Angular 18)

**A clone of Zillow built using Angular 18.**

## Description

This project is a simplified version of Zillow. This Zillow clone project is a practical application built as part of my Angular 18 learning journey. It demonstrates core Angular concepts like components, services, routing, and reactive forms, while providing a foundation for exploring more advanced real estate application features.
